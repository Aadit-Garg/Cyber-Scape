				Cyber Scape provides you with an immersive and fascinating experience of modern technology and world affairs. It is an experimental project by Aadit Garg and Tanmay Sharma of XI standard at S. D. Public School, Jagadhri, under the guidance of Mrs. Geetanjli. It packs a powerful chatbot that shows the characteristics of a human with its vocal abilities; it generates a response based on the famous technique of checking and biases. On the other hand, there is a news site, Newsroom-inc, which provides you with up-to-date news and information and updates every half hour to keep you updated. There is also a third website that one can use to get data about any book available online for free.
