				<p>Hand Model is a model made with the help of python and mediapipe it accurately track at most two
					hands
					at a time and provides accurate visuals. It also tracks bending motion of hands and their position.
					It have multiple use cases in real and commercial world.
					<br>
					<br>
				<ul>
					<li>It can be used for touchless controlling and can help in no sterile use cases.

					Body model is a model made with the help of python it takes in the use of opencv(computer
					vision) it is made possible by the model trained by tensorflow which is a free trained model bank
					provided by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> it consits of two models lighting and thunder
					model. lighting model is faster and provides with somewhat 30-45FPS but is less accurate. Whereas
					thunder model provides with abot 20-23FPS but is very accurate. It have multiple applications in
					real world.
					<br>
					<br>
				<ul>
					<li>It can help people keep track of their posture.</li>
					<br>
					<li>It can help people to make work on their body posture and language.</li>

						close.</li>
					<br>
					<li>To run the model start the <i>.exe</i> file and wait for a moment as it may take time to load on
						your
						computer
						based on its specs.</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						A prompt may appear in the command panel asking for a specific model dont ignore it.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>Don't close the command panel or the program will close.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Make sure that the model is in the same folder as the program.

					<li>
						<i>[FOR DEVS]</i> The python file is not stand-alone and requires specific libraries to
						run so please kindly download them, you can find the list of libraries in the <i>.py</i> file.
