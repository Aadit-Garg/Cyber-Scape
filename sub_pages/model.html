						Hand Model is a model made with the help of python and mediapipe. It
						accurately tracks at most two hands at a time and provides accurate
						visuals. It also tracks bending motion of hands and their position.
						It has multiple use cases in real and commercial world.
						<br />
						<br />
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							It can be used for touchless controlling and can help in no
							sterile use cases.
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							It can help in controlling possibly dangerous equipments like
							toaster or gyser for visually impaired.
						</li>
					</ul>

						Body model is a model made with the help of python. It takes in the
						use of OpenCV(Computer vision). It is made possible by the model
						trained by Tensorflow which is a free trained-models bank provided
						by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. It consits of two
						models lighting and thunder model. Lighting model is faster and
						provides around 30-45 FPS but is less accurate; whereas thunder
						model provides around 20-23 FPS but is very accurate. It has
						multiple applications in real world.
						<br />
						<br />
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							It can help people keep track of their postur during actions like
							walking or swimming.
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							It can help people to improve their body posture and language.
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>It can provide body posture data for research.</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							It can provide you with feedbacks of your body posture while doing
							workout or yoga etc.

						<br />
						<li>
							To run the model start the <i>.exe</i> file and wait for a moment

						<li>
							A prompt may appear in the command panel asking for a specific

						<li>Don't close the command panel or the program will close.</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							Make sure that the model is in the same folder as the program.
